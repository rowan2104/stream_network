Instruction on how to run my project.
Most of the project running can be handled by docker.

FIRST TIME RUN ONLY:
docker network create -d bridge --subnet 172.22.0.0/16 streaming_network

This network creation command only needs to be ran once.

docker build -t stream_network .

Once the image is built, so long as the docker file isn't modified it should not have to be rebuilt.

To run:

docker run -d --name broker1  --cap-add=ALL -w /work_space/Broker -it stream_network
docker network connect --ip=172.22.0.2 streaming_network broker1

docker run -d --name producer1  --cap-add=ALL -w /work_space/Producer -it stream_network
docker network connect --ip=172.22.1.1 streaming_network producer1

docker run -d --name consumer1  --cap-add=ALL -w /work_space/Consumer -it stream_network
docker network connect --ip=172.22.2.1 streaming_network consumer1

to run more producer or consumers, run the commands with the container name incremeneted,
and the last digit of the ip address incremeneted

The container will immediatly run the code on launch,
here are the commands for each container:

Producer:
connect <id> : connect the producer to the broker, id must be a 6 digit long string of only valid hex characters
eg: connect ab01ff

target <dir>: set the target directory for the files that the next stream will use
eg: target wiki_rope

stream <num> <types>: start streaming with the stream num set and content from the target dir of the given types.
The types are the first letters of each of the 3 core types
eg: stream 01 avt       (this stream is stream 01, eg ab01ff01 and streams audio, video and text content from the given directory)

delete <streamID> : stops/deletes a currently active stream.
eg: delete ab01ff01

disconnect: completely disconnect the producer from the broker, and stops all streams



Consumer:
connect  : connects the consumer to the broker

list    : request a list of all active streams from the broker

subscribe <streamid> : subscribe to a given stream via its streamID
eg: subscribe ab01ff01

unsubscribe <streamid> : unsubscribe to a given stream via its streamID
eg: unsubscribe ab01ff01

disconnect : disconnect the consumer from the broker
